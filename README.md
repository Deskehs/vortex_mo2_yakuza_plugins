# Yakuza Games Support Plugins for Vortex
Plugins for Yakuza game series to add support for [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).

# Requirements

[RyuModManager](https://github.com/SutandoTsukai181/RyuModManager/releases/latest) (v1.7+) has to be installed to the game directory and ran at least once. The extension will show a notification if this has not been done yet.

# Installing

# Usage

You can now use the **Mod Manager Download** option when downloading mods. All mods that mention **RyuModManager** (or **RMM**) in their description should be compatible with this extension. If a mod does not have that option, then you can still download it manually and drag its file to the mods tab in Vortex.

Vortex will show an error if the mod that was downloaded is not supported/has an invalid format. In that case, you can either install it manually or ask the mod author to reupload the mod with RMM support.

You can even convert an unsupported mod yourself, by following [these instructions](https://github.com/SutandoTsukai181/RyuModManager/wiki/Creating-A-New-Mod). All it requires is some basic understanding of the game's data directory layout (which you can get by reading the instructions). After repackaging the mod, you can install it to Vortex manually by dragging it to the mods tab in Vortex.

RyuModManager has to be run before launching the game whenever you install/enable/disable any mods. By default, this is done automatically. If you want to disable this for some reason and run it manually, you can disable the _RebuildMLO_ option in `YakuzaParless.ini`, which is generated by RyuModManager in the game directory.

# Credits

This extension was mostly based on the tutorial extension from [here](https://modding.wiki/en/vortex/developer/create-a-game-extension) and the Subnautica extension, so huge thanks to their authors.
